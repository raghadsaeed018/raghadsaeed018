## 🧠 About Me
I'm a high school senior with over **3 years of experience** in web application development, specializing in **Flask**, **AI integration**, and interactive user experiences.  

I thrive at the intersection of:
- **Web Application Development** → Creating user-friendly, secure, and responsive applications  
- **Artificial Intelligence** → Building tools with NLP, emotion detection, and real-time translation  
- **Cybersecurity** → Experimenting with ethical hacking tools, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessment to make systems safer  

I’ve built projects integrating **Hugging Face models**, **IBM Watson AI**, and **LangChain**, and I’m expanding into **security-focused web applications** with advanced authentication and verification features.
